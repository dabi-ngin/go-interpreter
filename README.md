# Go Interpreter

This is a semi-functional interpreter built on the principles of top-down parsing
and tree-walking interpretation. 

The fictional language MonkeyLang is a lisp style language that includes functions 
as first-class citizens, closures, higher order functions, and basic int/boolean
representations.

## State
This project is now fully inline with the final production of the Interpreter Book by Thorsten Ball, Compiler book project will be done as a fork of this repo.



## Distant future:
    - Interpreter -> Compiler


## Distant distant future:
    - Fork and rewrite as a C/C++ implementation with:
        -- Linker
        -- Assembler
        -- Basic build tools 
        -- LSP?
