# golang-interpreter
Simple interpreter built off of the back of the fantastic work of Thorsten Ball, first-class functions,
almost everything is an expression, written using TDOP parsing. Using this as a dummy project to rehash understanding
of Backus Naur Form and how parsing a context-free grammer works in practise. Fork or reuse as you wish,
ideas are not my own, i'll write an interpreter + compiler from scratch in another language based on the knowledge
i gain from using this book/project.
